Problem:
Given an expression of the form a+b, where a and b are integers from 0 to 9. You have to evaluate it and print the result.

Solution:

def computesum(x):
    x=x.split('+')
    a=int(x[0])
    b=int(x[1])
    result=a+b
    print(result)
    
testcases=int(input())
for i in range(testcases):
    computesum(input())
