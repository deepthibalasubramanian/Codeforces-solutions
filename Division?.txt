Problem:

Codeforces separates its users into 4 divisions by their rating:

For Division 1: 1900≤rating
For Division 2: 1600≤rating≤1899
For Division 3: 1400≤rating≤1599
For Division 4: rating≤1399
Given a rating, print in which division the rating belongs.

Input
The first line of the input contains an integer t (1≤t≤104) — the number of testcases.

The description of each test consists of one line containing one integer rating (−5000≤rating≤5000).

Output
For each test case, output a single line containing the correct division in the format 
"Division X", where X is an integer between 1 and 4 representing the division for the corresponding rating.

Solution:

testcases=int(input())
for i in range(testcases):
    rating=int(input())
    if(rating<=1399):
        print("Division 4")
    elif (rating<=1599):
        print("Division 3")
    elif (rating<=1899):
        print("Division 2")
    else:
        print("Division 1")
