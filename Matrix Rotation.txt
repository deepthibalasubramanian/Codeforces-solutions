Problem:
You have a matrix 2Ã—2 filled with distinct integers. 
You want your matrix to become beautiful. 
The matrix is beautiful if the following two conditions are satisfied:

in each row, the first element is smaller than the second element;
in each column, the first element is smaller than the second element.
You can perform the following operation on the matrix any number of times:
rotate it clockwise by 90 degrees, so the top left element shifts to the top right cell, 
the top right element shifts to the bottom right cell, and so on:
Determine if it is possible to make the matrix beautiful by applying zero or more operations.

Answer:

def rotate(arr):
    a=arr[0]
    arr[0]=arr[2]
    arr[2]=arr[3]
    arr[3]=arr[1]
    arr[1]=a
    return arr
    
t=int(input())
for i in range(t):
    arr=[]
    for j in range(2):
        x=input().split(" ")
        for k in range(2):
            arr.append(int(x[k]))
    flag=False
    for i in range(4):
        if(arr[0]<arr[1] and arr[0]<arr[2] and arr[2]<arr[3] and arr[1]<arr[3]):
            print("YES")
            flag=True
            break
        else:
            rotate(arr)
    if flag!=True:
        print("NO")
