Problem:

Two T-shirt sizes are given: a and b. 
The T-shirt size is either a string M or a string 
consisting of several (possibly zero) characters X 
and one of the characters S or L.

For example, strings M, XXL, S, XXXXXXXS could be 
the size of some T-shirts. And the strings XM, LL, SX are not sizes.

The letter M stands for medium, S for small, L for large. 
The letter X refers to the degree of size (from eXtra). 
For example, XXL is extra-extra-large (bigger than XL, and smaller than XXXL).

You need to compare two given sizes of T-shirts a and b.

The T-shirts are compared as follows:

any small size (no matter how many letters X) is smaller than the medium size and any large size;
any large size (regardless of the number of letters X) is larger than the medium size and any small size;
the more letters X before S, the smaller the size;
the more letters X in front of L, the larger the size.
For example:

XXXS < XS
XXXL > XL
XL > M
XXL = XXL
XXXXXS < M
XL > XXXS
Input
The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1≤t≤104) — the number of test cases.

Each test case consists of one line, in which a and b T-shirt sizes are written. The lengths of the strings corresponding to the T-shirt sizes do not exceed 50. It is guaranteed that all sizes are correct.

Output
For each test case, print on a separate line the result of comparing a and b T-shirt sizes (lines "<", ">" or "=" without quotes).

Solution:

testcases=int(input())
for i in range(testcases):
    inp=input().split(" ")
    size1=inp[0]
    size2=inp[1]
    l3=l4=0
    l1=size1[-1]
    l2=size2[-1]
    len1=len(size1)
    len2=len(size2)
    if len1>1:
        l3=size1[-2]
    if len2>1:
        l4=size2[-2]
    if (l1=='S' and l2=='M') or (l1=='S' and l2=='L') or (l1=='M' and l2=='L'):
        print('<')
    elif (l1=='L' and l2=='M') or (l1=='L' and l2=='S') or (l1=='M' and l2=='S'):
        print(">")
    elif l1=='S' and len2>len1:
        print('>')
    elif l1=='S' and len1>len2:
        print('<')
    elif len2>len1:
        print('<')
    elif len1>len2:
        print('>')
    else:
        print('=')
