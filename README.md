# Deepthi's Codeforces solutions

**Hello, Codeforces!**

*I am going to document all the solutions which I would be submitting on Codeforces in this repository.*

1. Given "A+B" as input, compute the equation and display result: *solved using Python 3* : Attempts=2
2. Given a 2 x 2 matrix, rotate and see if matrix is beautiful or not: *solved using Python 3* : Attempts=4
